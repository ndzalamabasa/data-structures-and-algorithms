Write a function fib(n) that takes a number as an argument,
the function should return the n-nth term of the fibonnaci sequence.

the first and second number of the sequence is 1, 
to generate the next number we sum the past two numbers 
fib(n)= fib(n-1)+ fib(n-2)

n=      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8   9  .....50
fib(n)= 1  1  2  3  5  8  13 21  34 .....12586269025
